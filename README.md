FRIB SpecTcl is a histogramming program with a low learning curve.  The
embedded Tcl/Tk scripting language makes layering graphical user interfaces
a simple process. An alternative based on Python bindings for C++ is offered. 
It adopts common Python libraries for basic and more advanced numerical algorithms. The GUI is written on PyQt5 for modularity and extensibility.
