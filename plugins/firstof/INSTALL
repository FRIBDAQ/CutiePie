Installation follows the form:

./configure --prefix=target-dir
make install


Note that generally target-dir should be the location in which you've installed
your SpecTcl.  The plugin will be installed in the TclLibs subdirectory of the
target-dir.  If you choose to install this plugin in a different directory
tree than SpecTcl

./configure --prefix=target-dir --with-spectcl-home=SpectclHome

where SpecTclHome is the top level of the SpecTcl installation directory tree.

./configure --help

provides the usual description of the plethora of options configure accepts.
