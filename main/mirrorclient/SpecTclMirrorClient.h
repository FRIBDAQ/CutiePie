#define SPECTCLMIRRORCLIENT_H

/**
 * This header provides the application programming interface for clients
 * programs that want access to SpecTcl spectrum shared memory.  SpecTcl runs
 * as many as two servers:
 *   *  A REST server provides HTTP access to pretty much all of SpecTcl's functions.
 *      This is needed by this API to provide the size of the local shared memory,
 *      and to determine if a shared memory mirror in this host already exists.
 *   *  A Mirror server supports on demand updates of the contents of the SpecTcl
 *      spectrum shared memory.  This is needed for obvious resons.
 *
 *  From the application's point of view we want to hide all of the negotiations
 *  that go on at the REST level to determine if there is a mirror and all of the
 *  junk needed to run the mirrorclient application and just provide a single,
 *  simple function that can be called which will return a pointer to the
 *  mirrored shared memory, regardless how it was gotten. 
 *
 * @note the API in this softwre is usable from C or C++.
