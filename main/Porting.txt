Porting applications from SpecTcl 4.0 and earlier
should be relatively simple though you will need to
make a slight adjustment to your MySpecTclApp.cpp
file (or equivalent).

At the bottom of this file, in 4.0 and earlier
you'll see something like:

CMySpecTclApp   myApp;
CTclGrammerApp& app(myApp);	// Create an instance of me.
CTCLApplication* gpTCLApplication=&app;  // Findable by the Tcl/tk framework.


Please change this to look like:


CMySpecTclApp   myApp;

#ifdef SPECTCL_5_INIT
CTclGrammerApp* CTclGrammerApp::m_pInstance = &myApp;
CTCLApplication* gpTCLApplication;

#else
CTclGrammerApp& app(myApp);	// Create an instance of me.
CTCLApplication* gpTCLApplication=&app;  // Findable by the Tcl/tk framework.
#endif


This change results in a MySpecTclApp.cpp that is compatible
with SpecTcl 5 and all earlier versions of SpecTcl by only
changing the INSTDIR definition of the Makefile.
