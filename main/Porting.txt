Porting applications from SpecTcl 4.0 and earlier
should be relatively simple though you will need to
make a slight adjustment to your MySpecTclApp.cpp
file (or equivalent).

At the bottom of this file, in 4.0 and earlier
you'll see something like:

CMySpecTclApp   myApp;
CTclGrammerApp& app(myApp);	// Create an instance of me.
CTCLApplication* gpTCLApplication=&app;  // Findable by the Tcl/tk framework.


Please change this to look like:


CMySpecTclApp   myApp;

#ifdef SPECTCL_5_INIT
CTclGrammerApp* CTclGrammerApp::m_pInstance = &myApp;
CTCLApplication* gpTCLApplication;

#else
CTclGrammerApp& app(myApp);	// Create an instance of me.
CTCLApplication* gpTCLApplication=&app;  // Findable by the Tcl/tk framework.
#endif


This change results in a MySpecTclApp.cpp that is compatible
with SpecTcl 5 and all earlier versions of SpecTcl by only
changing the INSTDIR definition of the Makefile.


SpecTcl 5.x provides a new displayer based on Root/Qt called "spectra"
If you want to use this displayer add

set DisplayType spectra

to your SpecTclInit.tcl file.

Other values for this variable are:  “xamine”   - use the Xamine displayer
“none” don’t start any displayer.

SpecTcl 5.1 includes a partial integration with Root (6.10.06):

- Spectra are now maintained as Root histograms.
- the rootinterface Tcl package provides commands to get SpecTcl to write
  root trees as well as to execute root macros.

 See the SpecTcl command reference at http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq for
 documentation, specifically the rootexec and roottree commands.

NOTE:  If you use module load root in your .bashrc be sure to

module load root/gnu/6.10.06 

Otherwise the module load command will define LD_LIBRARY_PATH pointing at the
wrong version of Root which will cause SpecTcl's root integration problems.
