##
#   Input to create a toml file for CPyCoverter
#   We need a .in file because we need to specify where
#   libCPyConverter is installed
#
#   This is for sip-v6 e.g.

[build-system]
requires = ["sip >=6, <7"]
build-backend = "sipbuild.api"

#  Module name:

[tool.sip.metadata]
name = "CPyConverter"

[tool.sip.bindings.CPyConverter]
headers = ["CPyConverter.h"]
include-dirs=[".", "../../mirrorclient/", "../src"]
libraries=["python312", "npymath",  "MirrorClient"]
extra-objects = ["../src/x64/release/CPyConverter.obj", 
	"../src/x64/release/dataAccess.obj", 
	"../src/x64/release/dataRetriever.obj"]
#
#  Because these library-dirs can't seen to be relative,
#  and because AppData is specific to a users
#  and because the building user may be different than me,
#  This line, in general will need editing...
#  would be nice if toml supported substitutable variables.
#  But alas the world is not perfect.. In a later part of my life,
#  I think the thing to do is to have this file generated from some in file
#  with appropriate processing.
