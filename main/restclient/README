The goal of this directory is to provide support for SpecTcl UIS interacting
with a remote SpecTcl.  The goal is to provide support for SpecTcl run as a
program under the DAQ Manager.

There will be essentially three packages:
#
# SpecTclRESTClient - provides a Snit type that, given host and port
#                     knows how to interact with SpecTcl via its REST server.
# SpecTclRemote     - Provides facades for all of the SpecTcl commands
#                     (feasible) that operate via SpecTclRESTCLient
#                     including this package into a GUI is sufficient to
#                     be able to run an existing GUI for a SpecTcl running
#                     remotely or disconnected from any terminal
# SpecTclManager    - Wrapper for SpecTclRemote that interacts with a port manager
#                     when SpecTcl has registered as a service with the port manager
#                     as we expect it to under the DAQ manager.
